### Plaid Case Study Proposal

1. Plaid is a company that specializes in developing APIs for interacting with Banking systems. Visa bought them, making MasterCard eventually their rival. 

2. They use technology to gather APIs from customers to send to banks. 

3. Since plaid is so deeply enmeshed in the FinTech ecosystem, many people are likely to use the Plaid API.
